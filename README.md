# üêäüê¶ Hybrid RSA-PSO: A Hybrid Reptile Search Algorithm with Particle Swarm Optimization

This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of **Hybrid RSA-PSO**, a novel metaheuristic algorithm that combines the exploratory power of the Reptile Search Algorithm (RSA) with the exploitative behavior of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

Hybrid RSA-PSO was tested on over **30 benchmark functions** (CEC2014, CEC2017, etc.) and several **real-world engineering design problems** such as pressure vessel and gear train optimization. The results show consistently improved performance over original RSA, PSO, and other leading algorithms like GWO, MPA, WOA, and HO.
